This "small" project allows users to toggle elements based on a number of different criteria that they can select. Created using the JS library; anime.js. 

CRITERIA: 

1) Toggle Special: Translates special square down 250 pixels.
2) Toggle First Green: Translates first green square down 250 pixels.
3) Toggle Red and Yellow: Translates red and yellow squares down 250 pixels.
4) Toggle Odd: Translates odd position squares down 250 pixels.
5) Toggle Not-Black: Translates all squares that aren't black down 250 pixels.
6) Toggle Rotation: Rotates all squares 360 degrees.
8) Toggle Custom: Custom movement of all squares using sin and angles.

WHY: 

Its a fun project that allows users to toggle the squares as they like and to see how it performs using continuous toggle clicks. Also, I enjoy JavaScript, so using one of the libraries was fun.
